# LifeStealer

This is my CORE 1 coursework project for my studies.
Lifestealer is a simple social media platform built with React and Express.js.
User can add posts, add friends to friends list and have a chat with them!
The app does not support small screens.

Lifestealer is avaiable live at: https://lifestealer.herokuapp.com/

This repo contains only frontend code, backend code can be found in lifestealer-api.
